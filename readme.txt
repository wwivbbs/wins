                WWIV Inetnet Network Support v5.0 README
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is the WIN32 native port of the PPP project.  It uses native WIN32 
Winsock2 calls to talk over the network.  If you use a dialup connection, you
must first establish a RAS connection before using this. (like NETWORKP.EXE
was in PPP Project 1.x to 2.x).


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
(1) Make sure to back everything up first.
(2) Copy the executables into your WWIV home directory (i.e. C:\BBS), these
    will overwrite most of the existing PPP project executables.



Limitations
~~~~~~~~~~~
(1) Not as widely tested as PPP Project 1.x to 2.x
(2) NTIME.EXE is not ported yet.

Important Announcements

Infinite thanks to Frank for not only writing the PPP project, but helping me
numerous times in porting this with all sorts of questions for the various
problems that I encountered and caused myself.
