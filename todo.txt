PPP Project version 5.0 TODO List
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Start using WFile for file IO

* Make safe free call (i.e. check for NULL first)

* make safe fclose call (i.e. check for NULL first)

* Look for other blocks of code to make 'safe' (reduce redundancies in the
  codebase)

* Make net.ini into an .xml file, using the Apache Project XML parser for
  C++.

* consolidate NET.INI parsing, and put data into 1 structure instead of
  scattered global variables.  Use WIniFile for INI file parsing.

* split main method of pop.cpp unto 3 methods (1 main, 1 send, 1 receive)

* reduce number of global variables.

* Improve debug diagnostics
